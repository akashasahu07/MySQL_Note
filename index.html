            <h3>Introduction to Database:</h3>
            <ul>
                <li>Data is a set of raw facts(mostly numerical). This data can be refined. The refined data callled
                    information(mostly words).</li>
                <li><span>Example: Data says Male, Female populations in country and information makes statements on
                        that
                        data.</span></li>
            </ul>

            <h3>Why we need Database?</h3>
            <ul>
                <li>To read data, Delete data, Update Data and Analyse Data.</li>
            </ul>

            <h3>SQL vs MySQL</h3>
            <ul>
                <li>MySQL is database management system which is used to Create, Update, Delete, or Access the database.
                </li>
                <li>SQL is a language which is used to communication (CRUD) opertation with database.</li>
                <li>In simple words, DBMS like MySQL uses SQL to do operations on database</li>
                <li>Before SQL, data used to be stores in file management system. It is easy to manage but will not have
                    any relations between the data repetation is heavily possible.</li>
                <li><span>Example: Ms Access.</span></li>
                <li>Later RDBMS(Relational Database Management System) came into existance. In RDBMS, data is stored in
                    tbales. Tables contains rows and columns. Every table may have relation with other table.</li>
                <li>There are so many popular RDBMS like MySQL, Oracle, PostgreSQL, SQLite, SQL Server etc.</li>
            </ul>

            <h3>Download And Install MySQL</h3>
            <ul>
                <li>Type MySQL Download for windows</li>
                <li>Select MySQL Community</li>
                <li>Select Full and Execute and Install</li>
                <li>Set up Password</li>
                <li>Download and Install MySQL Workbench</li>
                <li>Open Workbench (It is GUI tool) to write SQL code to make sure understand</li>
            </ul>

            <h3 class="center" id="mysql">MySQL</h3>
            <div class="mysql">
                <ul>
                    <li>MySQL follows RDBMS, here every data is linked with tables. Tables uses row and columns</li>
                    <li>Open Workbench and create a blank page and test</li>
                    <li>To create Database in MySQL</li>
                    <code>CREATE DATABASE "database-name";</code>
                    <li>To use Database</li>
                    <code>USE "database-name";</code>
                </ul>

                <h3>Datatypes</h3>
                <ul>
                    <li>Datatypes are used to define the type of data it holds. MySQL provides numerous datatypes. Out
                        of
                        which, popular/frequently used are: </li>
                    <ul>
                        <li><b>Int: </b>Used for integer columns.</li>
                        <span>Example: Only integers can be allowed.</span>
                        <li><b>Varchar: </b>Used for string columns with the Dynamic number of characters.</li>
                        <span>Example: varchar(4) [means only characters allowed max 4 not moer than 4]</span>
                        <span>Ram, Raju, Sam (is allowed) Krish(not allowed)</span>
                        <li><b>Char: </b>Used for string columns with fixed number of characters.</li>
                        <span>char(1) [only one character is allowed not more not less]</span>
                        <li><b>Decimal(min total digit, min total digit after decimal): </b>Used for decimal values.
                        </li>
                        <span>Example: decimal(10, 2)</span>
                        <li><b>Date: </b>Used for complete dates.</li>
                        <span>Format: 'YYYY-MM-DD' [2025-02-06]</span>
                    </ul>
                </ul>

                <h3>MySQL Commands</h3>
                <p>MySQL commands are divided mainly as 4 sub languages.</p>
                <ul>
                    <li><b>DDL(Data Definition language): </b>These commands help us to structure our database</li>
                    <span>Example: CREATE, ALTER, RENAME, DROP, TRUNCATE etc.</span>
                    <li><b>DML(Data Manipulation Language): </b>These commands help us to manipulate or update or delete

                        data.</li>
                    <span>Example: INSERT, UPDATE, DELETE etc.</span>
                    <ul>
                        <li>These commands also contain sub part called</li>
                        <li><b>DQL(Data Query Language): </b>It's command is <span>select</span> which is used for
                            queries.
                        </li>
                    </ul>
                    <li><b>DCL(Data Control Language): </b>These commands helps to control the data which user
                        manipulate.
                    </li>
                    <span>Example: GRANT, REVOKE etc.</span>
                    <li><b>TCL(Transaction Control Language): </b>These commands helps to control the transactions and
                        undo
                        the previous query.</li>
                    <span>Example: COMMIT, ROLLBACK, SAVEPOINT etc.</span>
                </ul>

                <h3>DDL(Data Definition Language)</h3>
                <p>These commands are used to build the structure of database.</p>
                <ul>
                    <li><b>create: </b>Create is used to create databases, tables, views etc.</li>

                            ALTER TABLE students ADD COLUMN gender char(1);</code>
                            <p>If you need to add a column in a specific location like after a perticular column we want
                                to
                                add a column then</p>
                            <span>Example: </span><br>
                            <code>-- After sname add phone Number <br>

                <p>They are used to remove data, but they function differently.</p>
                <ul>
                    <li><b>DELETE: </b>Removes specific rows from a table based on a WHERE condition. If no WHERE clause
                        is

                    <span>Syntax: </span> <code>DROP TABLE "table-name";</code>
                </ul>

                <h3>DML(Data Manipulation Language)</h3>
                <p>These commands are used to manipulate the database such as inserting data into tables, updating data
                    in
                    tables, deleting data from tables.</p>

                <ul>
                    <li><b>INSERT: </b>Insert command is used to insert the data in tables.</li>
                    <span>Syntax: </span>
                    <code>INSERT INTO "table-name" VALUES (col1-value), (col2-value), (col3-value),... etc);</code><br>
                    <span>Example: </span> <code>-- Insert values in table <br>
                    INSERT INTO students VALUES <br>(1, "Tony",789654, 20000.00, "M"),<br>
                    (2, "Natasa", 456987, 25000.00, "F"),<br>
                    (3, "Steve", 873546, 30000.00, "M");</code>
                    <p>This will insert 3 row data at a time.</p>
                </ul>

                <h3>Constraints</h3>
                <p>In MySQL, tables consists of columns which need to follow certain conditions. The conditions or rules
                    set
                    to the columns are called Constraints.</p>
                <ul>
                    <li><b>UNIQUE: </b>Any column which contains <span>UNIQUE</span> constraints must have unique values
                        for
                        every record. Unique also accepts NULL values empty ones are filled with NULL value.</li>
                    <li><b>NOT NULL: </b>Any column which contains <span>NOT NULL</span> constraint must contain values
                        which are not null. Required fields.</li>
                    <li><b>AUTO INCREMENT: </b>Any column which contains auto increment will increment the value of
                        column
                        automatically.</li>
                    <li><b>DEFAULT: </b>Any column which contains default constraint can provides a value default to all
                        rows. If user forget to add value it will add the default value to that row.</li>
                    <li><b>CHECK: </b>Any column which contains <span>CHECK </span>constraints is used to check all
                        values
                        in that column are satisfying a condition or not. If i set user should enter their age should
                        greater than 18 then only age that greater than 18 should accepted.</li>
                    <li><b>PRIMARY KEY: </b>Primary key must be unique and not null value. It is a column by which we
                        can
                        identify each
                        and every row individually.</li>
                    <li><b>FOREIGN KEY: </b>Foreign Key is a Primary key in another table and got as a reference to this
                        table.</li>
                </ul>
                <span>Example: </span><code>-- Create table employee <br>
                create table employees ( <br>eid int primary key auto_increment, ename varchar(30) not null, 
                <br>age int check(age >= 18), country varchar(20) default "India", <br>salary decimal(10,2)
                );</code>
                <p>If you want to add specific row values then</p>
                <span>Example: </span><code>insert into employees (ename, age, salary) values
                    ("Stark", 27, 45000);</code>

                <ul>
                    <li>Having is used in combination with the group by clause. It will work after the group by has
                        worked
                        and where is worked before group by.</li>

                </ul>

                <h3>Difference between 'Where' and 'Having'</h3>
                <ul>
                    <li>'Where' will be applied before group by. 'Having' will be applied after group by.</li>
                    <li>'Where' cann't handle aggregate functions. 'Having' can handle aggregate function.</li>
                    <span>Example: </span><code>count(), sum() etc.</code>
                    <li>'Where' and 'Having' both can use and /or and used for condition only.</li>
                </ul>

                <h3>Sub - Queries</h3>
                <ul>
                    <li>A subquery is a query nested inside another query. The inner query (Sub Query) returns result
                        that
                        is
                        used by outer query.</li>
                    <span>Syntax:
                    </span><code>select columns from table1 where column = (select columns from table where condition);</code>

                    <p><b>Q: </b>WAQ to print the name, country and salary of the person who have highest salary than
                        india
                        highest salary?</p>
                    <span>Ans:
                    </span><code>select ename, country, salary from employees where salary > (select max(salary) from employees where country = "India");</code>

                    <p><b>Q: </b>WAQ to print list of student names, marks whose marks are greater than average male
                        students mark?</p>
                    <span>Ans:
                    </span><code>select sname, smark from students where smark > (select avg(smark) from students group by gender having gender = "M");</code>
                </ul>

                <h3>Indexes</h3>
                <ul>
                    <li>Indexes are used to speed up data retrival operations on database tables. It helps to retrive
                        the
                        data faster.</li>
                    <li>It works like books index allowing database to find rows quickly without scanning entire table
                        or
                        going row after row.</li>
                    <li>By default index will be created for primary key.</li>
                    <li>Create index:</li>
                    <span>Syntax: </span><code>create index "index-name" on "table-name"("column-name");</code>
                    <li>Delete Index:</li>
                    <span>Syntax: </span><code>drop index "index-name";</code>
                    <li>Indexes speed up Where, Order by, group by etc... commands but over indexing slows down Insert,
                        Delete, Update.</li>
                    <span>Example: </span><code>create index stdName on students(sname);</code>
                </ul>

                <h3>Views</h3>
                <ul>
                    <li>Views are used as a virtual table based on the result of a SQL Query. It does not store data
                        physically but provides a way to simplify queries.</li>
                    <li>View is a temporary table which is used to create by the result of another Query.</li>
                    <li>It acts like abstract layer over tables.</li>
                    <li>It provides security to the tables. Views cann't have indexes.</li>
                    <span>Syntax: </span><code>create view stdInfo as ("Query");</code><br>
                    <span>Example:
                    </span><code>create view stdInfo as select sname, smark from students where gender = 'M';</code>
                </ul>

                <h3>Stored Procedure</h3>
                <ul>
                    <li>A stored procedure is a precompiled collection of SQL statements stored in the database. It can
                        accept inputs as parameters and perform operations.</li>
                    <li>It is used to improve performance and cache results in database it's main use is code
                        reusability.
                    </li>
                    <span>Syntax:
                    </span><code>delimiter // 
                    <br>create procedure "procedure_name"(parameter) 
                    <br>begin "Query" end 
                    <br>// 
                    <br>call "procedure_name"(argument)</code><br>
                    <span>Example: </span><code>delimiter // 
                    <br>create procedure countryWise(c varchar(20))
                    <br>begin select * from employees where country = c; end 
                    <br>//
                    <br>call countryWise("India");</code>

                    <p><b>Q: </b>Create a stored procedure that accepts a value (salary amount) and it should print all
                        employees having more than mentioned?</p>
                    <span>Ans: </span>
                    <code>delimiter //
                <br>create procedure GreaterSal(sal decimal(10, 2)) 
                <br>begin
                <br>select * from employees where salary > sal;
                <br>end
                <br>//
                    
                <br>call GreaterSal(80000);</code>
                </ul>

                <h3>Functions</h3>
                <p>Functions in MySQL also called stored functions. They are similar to "Stored Procedure" but they
                    return a
                    value.</p>
                <span>Syntax:</span>
                <code>
                delimiter //
                <br>create function "function-name" () returns "data-type"
                <br>begin 
                <br>logic
                <br>return value;
                <br>end
                <br>//
            </code>

                <p><b>Q: </b>WAF that goes to each record/row and increase salary and return their sum?</p>
                <span>Ans: </span>
                <code>
                declare sumValues decimal(10, 2)
                <br>delimiter //
                <br>create function salaryUpdate() returns decimal(10, 2)
                <br>begin
                <br>select sum(salary) into sumValues
                <br>from employeesbr
                <br>return salary
                <br>end //
                <br>sumValues()

                <h3>DCL Commands</h3>
                <ul>
                    <li>These commnads are used to control the data such that it gives control over how data should be
                        passed.</li>
                    <li>The commands are <span>GRANT</span> and <span>REVOKE</span>.</li>
                    <p><b>GRANT: </b>Grant is used to provide privilages to be granted.</p>
                    <span>Example: </span>
                    <code>Select, Insert, Delete etc.</code>

                    <p><b>REVOKE: </b>Revoke is used take the privilages to be granted.</p>
                    <span>Example: </span>
                    <code>Rolebased Databases</code>
                </ul>

                <h3>TCL (Transaction Control Language)</h3>
                <p>These commands are used to manage/control the transactions. Every statement can itself a transaction.
                </p>
                <ul>
                    <li><b>ROLLBACK: </b>Rollback is used to bring databse of pervious state. If want to retrive the
                        previous deleted data then must use "set autocommit = false". Beacuse MySQL by default "set
                        autocommit = true". Rollback return to the first state.</li>

                    <span>To Delete: </span>
                    <code>set autocommit = false;

                    <li><b>COMMIT: </b>Commit is used to save the database of current state and remove the previous
                        states
                        permanently.</li>
                    <li><b>SAVEPOINT: </b>Creates a Savepoint within the transaction so that rollback will go to that
                        particular point. <br>It helps to goes at the specific point which is deleted when but rollback
                        goes
                        at the first state it doesn't care after first what you change.</li>

                <ul>
                    <li>It is the process of organizing data in tables/databases to minimize data redundancy and improve
                        data integrity.</li>
                    <li><b>1NF: </b>Each cell in a table must contain atomic value(only one value).</li>

                        <code>
                            MySQL supports different types of storage engines for tables, including:

                            <br>🔸InnoDB – Default storage engine, supports transactions, foreign keys, and crash recovery.
                            <br>🔸MyISAM – Fast read operations, no support for transactions or foreign keys.
                            <br>🔸Memory (HEAP) – Stores data in RAM for quick access, but data is lost on restart.
                            <br>🔸CSV – Stores data in plain text CSV format, useful for data exchange.
                            <br>🔸ARCHIVE – Optimized for storing large amounts of historical data with high compression.
                            <br>🔸MERGE (MRG_MYISAM) – Combines multiple MyISAM tables into a single table.
                            <br>🔸FEDERATED – Connects to external MySQL databases without storing data locally.
                        </code>

                        <li><b>Explain the difference between CHAR and VARCHAR.?</b></li>
                        <span>Ans: </span>
                        <code>
                            🔸CHAR is a fixed-length data type, meaning it always uses the defined space, even if the stored value is shorter. It is faster for fixed-size data.

                            <br>🔸VARCHAR is a variable-length data type that only uses the space needed for the actual data, plus extra bytes for length storage. It is more efficient for storing varying-length text.
                        </code>

                        <li><b>What is a primary key?</b></li>
                        <span>Ans: </span>
                        <code>A primary key is a unique identifier for each record in a table. It ensures that no duplicate or NULL values exist in the specified column(s).</code>

                        <li><b>What is a foreign key?</b></li>
                        <span>Ans: </span>
                        <code>A foreign key is a column in one table that establishes a relationship with the primary key of another table. It enforces referential integrity by ensuring valid relationships between records.</code>

                        <li><b>What is an index in MySQL?</b></li>
                        <span>Ans: </span>
                        <code>An index in MySQL is a data structure that improves the speed of data retrieval operations on a table. It helps in faster searching but may slow down insert, update, and delete operations due to additional maintenance.</code>

                        <li><b>Explain the different types of indexes in MySQL.?</b></li>
                        <span>Ans: </span>
                        <code>🔸Primary Index – Automatically created for the primary key, ensures unique and fast lookups.
                            <br>🔸Unique Index – Prevents duplicate values in a column, ensuring uniqueness.
                            <br>🔸Full-Text Index – Used for text-based searches in large data sets.
                            <br>🔸Composite Index – Created on multiple columns to optimize queries using those columns together.
                            <br>🔸Spatial Index – Used for geographic data in spatial databases.
                            <br>🔸Clustered Index – Organizes table rows based on the primary key, improving retrieval speed.</code>

                        <li><b>What is a unique key?</b></li>
                        <span>Ans:</span>
                        <code>A unique key is a constraint that ensures all values in a column (or combination of columns) are unique across the table. Unlike a primary key, it allows NULL values but prevents duplicates.</code>

                        <span>Ans: </span>
                        <code>
                            MySQL works on a client-server model:

                            <br>🔸The server is where the actual database is stored and managed. It handles requests, processes data, and sends results back.

                            <br>🔸The client is what we use to interact with the server. It can be a command-line tool, a software like MySQL Workbench, or a program using Python, PHP, etc.

                <h3>Terminology</h3>
                <ul>
                    <li>In MongoDB, whole database is also called schema.</li>
                    <li>Documents replaces records of tables. Feilds in the documents are similar to columns.</li>
                    <li>Collections are similar to tables.</li>
                </ul>

                <h3>How to create Database in MongoDB</h3>
                <p>We can create database in MongoDB in two ways. MongoDB databases cann't be created empty, so we need
                    to create a collection inside the MongoDB to connect database.</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>Open MongoDB compass, make a connection (default -- localhost: 27017).
                        <br>You can see list of databases, we can create one using "+" symbol on top.
                    </li>
                    <li>Beside "+", we can see ">_" MongoDB shell ope it and write.
                        <br><code>&gt; use office 
                            <br>&lt; switched to db office
                            <br> &gt; db.createCollection('employees')
                            <br>&lt; { ok : 1}
                            </code>
                        <br>Then refresh
                        <br>
                        ("<b>use 'database-name</b>': It will uses database, if there is no database with specific name,
                        it creates and use it.")
                    </li>
                    <li>You cann't create database without collection.</li>
                    <li><b>create a collection: </b>Collection is a group of MongoDB documents it is equivalent to MySQL
                        tables. A collection exists within a single database. Collections don't enforce a schema.</li>
                    <span>Syntax: </span>
                    <code>db.createCollection('collection-name')</code>
                    <li><b>Drop collection: </b>To drop the collection, we can use(If we delete collection database
                        automatically deleted)</li>

                    <code>db.'collection-name'.drop()</code>

                    <p><b>What is Replication?</b></p>
                    <ul>
                        <li>It is process of synchronizing the data into multiple servers.</li>
                        <li>Replication provides redundancy and increases data availability.</li>
                        <li>It distributes multiple copies to multiple servers without any difference.</li>
                        <li>Each seb-server is called <b>replica set</b>.</li>

                        <li><b>Replica sets</b> is a group of two or more devices called nodes.</li>
                        <li>In every replica set, there is one master node/primary server and others are secondary.</li>
                        <li>Data always flow from primary to secondary.</li>
                        <li>In case of loss of primary node, In the remaining nodes one will be elected as primary node.
                        </li>
                        <li>In case of maintainence, secondary will become primary and after the maintainence again it
                            will become secondary.</li>
